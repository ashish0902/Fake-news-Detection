rodríguez per affrontare la guerra finanziaria degli stati uniti è urgente che paesi brics rafforzino la cooperazione nell economia e nella finanza la nuova banca di sviluppo dei paesi brics dovrebbe aumentare il volume dei prestiti ed anche l accordo sul contingente di riserva inoltre paesi brics dovrebbero avviare al più presto possibile la propria agenzia di rating per intensificare la coesione economica e realizzare un area di libero scambio si dovranno abbattere le barriere tariffarie ed aumentare notevolmente il commercio breve se non vengono prese al più presto le misure del caso paesi brics rischiano il naufragio nel prossimo uragano finanziario rete voltaire città del messico messico 27 ottobre 2016 français русский español il 15 e 16 ottobre si teneva nello stato di goa india l ottavo vertice dei brics sigla per brasile russia india cina e sud africa va riconosciuto che l incontro avveniva una situazione profondamente critica per l economia mondiale tuttavia brics hanno mostrato ancora una volta la straordinaria capacità di trasformare un brutto momento un opportunità per approfondire legami dal punto di vista strategico dopo che le economie brics hanno goduto di un età dell oro negli ultimi anni tassi di crescita hanno subito un drastico rallentamento di fronte questa situazione difficile os più che mai brics devono attingere alle istituzioni finanziarie presentate al mondo un paio di anni prima fortaleza brasile al sesto vertice 1 lo scorso aprile la nuova banca di sviluppo effettuava il primo prestito 2 per più di 800 milioni di dollari e dal 2017 si stima che prestiti possano raggiungere 2500 milioni 3 inoltre l istituto finanziario luglio emetteva per la prima volta obbligazioni verdi yuan per un importo pari 450 milioni di dollari 4 questi strumenti finanziari se aumentano l influenza globale della moneta cinese finanziano grandi progetti investimento nel frattempo l accordo sul contingente di riserva cra nell acronimo inglese dal valore di 100 miliardi di dollari è pronto concedere le prime linee di credito per stabilizzare la bilancia dei pagamenti dei paesi brics come annunciato dal ministro delle finanze indiano arun jaitley 5 ogni volta che la federal reserve fed degli stati uniti minaccia di aumentare il tasso interesse dei fondi federali innescando una nuova crisi finanziaria mondiale è necessario che paesi brics aumentino al più presto le risorse monetarie del fondo di stabilizzazione perché caso contrario rischiano gravi danni per via delle speculazioni delle grandi banche investimento allo stesso tempo paesi brics devono aprire nuovi fronti sfidando apertamente l egemonia degli stati uniti e del dollaro nel sistema finanziario globale 6 non solo attraverso lo scambio valuta locale per esempio attraverso l accumulo di riserve yuan tra le banche centrali soprattutto dopo che la moneta del popolo renminbi cinese è stata ammessa ufficialmente il 1 ottobre 2015 tra diritti speciali di prelievo il paniere delle monete élite creato dal fondo monetario internazionale fmi alla fine degli anni 60 7 inoltre paesi brics possono articolare un alleanza finanziaria dai forti legami geopolitici tra america latina asia africa e medio oriente le banche di sviluppo regionali formate per lo più da paesi periferici potrebbero servire allo scopo la banca investimento infrastrutturale asiatica aiib nell acronimo inglese banca dell alba alleanza bolivariana per popoli della nostra america e anche la banca del sud che finalmente aprirà alla fine dell anno è un requisito urgente per brics realizzare una propria agenzia di rating che spezzi il dominio delle statunitensi fitch moody e standard poor 8 talus agenzie di rating piuttosto che effettuare valutazioni con criteri tecnici agiscono su impulso di natura politica cioè da autentiche macchine da guerra degradano le note delle obbligazioni sovrane e di conseguenza aumentano drasticamente gli oneri finanziari di paesi come grecia russia venezuela la coesione economica è un altra sfida importante anche se è chiaro che si è progredito sostanzialmente molto negli ultimi anni tra il 2001 e il 2015 il commercio tra paesi brics nell ambito del commercio totale è raddoppiato dal 6 al 12 9 la cina è di gran lunga l economia più integrata nei paesi brics al contrario legami tra india e sud africa sono marginali lo stesso tra brasile e russia e quindi molto importante la prossima creazione di una zona di libero scambio tra brics 10 tuttavia oltre ad abbattere le barriere commerciali paesi brics devono promuovere la costruzione congiunta dei valori cioè integrare propri sistemi di produzione per incoraggiare l industrializzazione delle economie meno avvantaggiate conclusione vi sono molte sfide orizzonte per le cinque potenze emergenti sono convinto che perciò il successo dei brics dipenda dalla capacità di reinventarsi e dalla creatività nell articolare nuove dimensioni della cooperazione affrontando obiettivi lungo termine di fronte alla nuova guerra finanziaria che preparano gli usa è tempo per brics di procedere',\n",

       " ' курды разрубят ближневосточный узел мир азия ближний восток ближний восток превратился в самую большую мировую головоломку части которой уже никогда не сойдутся в изначальный рисунок потому что региональная специфика помноженная на западные амбиции приводит к полному провалу и неразберихе которые мы имеем сегодня в сирии и пока америка в предвыборной агонии усиленно разбрасывается грязным бельем мы рассмотрим вектор развития российско турецких отношений на фоне сирийского конфликта вкупе с западными потугами сохранить демократический имидж 0 комментариев 0 поделились фото ap сделать это скажу я вам непросто потому что политические перипетии и так явление не для слабонервных но когда в одном котле замешаны россия турция сша полуразвалившаяся сирия курды европа игил запрещенная в россии террористическая организация ред и т д то здесь одной статьей не обойтись начнем с крайней обеспокоенности анкары по поводу активной поддержки курдов вашингтоном и обеспокоенность эта столь велика что подталкивает турцию к военному сотрудничеству с москвой вплоть до того что некоторые российские политики на радостях наивно предположили что турция выйдет из нато это вполне характерно для российско турецких отношений когда из полной безоговорочной эйфории катастрофически безнадежных отношений впадаем в эйфорию чуть ли не идеальных но это лишь крупный план нового витка взаимодействия россии и турции а на заднем плане можно рассмотреть много моментов которые остаются за кадром мы знаем что в данный момент действия турции в сирии совместно с сирийской свободной армией продолжаются пусть и не так активно как в начале операции на то есть две причины во первых турцию в сирии жестко контролируют сша а во вторых она уже подходит к тем стратегическим точкам где игил держится намного крепче например эль баб чем в других районах откуда они уже ушли что касается города дабыка то это отдельная история имеющая для игил особый идеологический характер так как по исламской религии священный бой между мусульманами и неверными должен пройти именно в этом населенном пункте и то по последней информации дабык уже находится под контролем турции совместно со свободной сирийской армией что то очень быстро закончился священный бой также запад четко обозначил что не хочет участия турции в операциях по спасению ракии и мосула одним словом без слез на все эти рокировки не взглянешь еще пару месяцев назад действия турции в регионе были ограничены из за россии но уже сегодня свобода действий наступила благодаря россии и все это вопреки воле военного союза в котором турция находится турция осталась вне игры на ближнем востоке из за россии но и вернулась она туда благодаря той же россии и то что сегодня она может остаться вне игры уже из за сша кардинально меняет дело а такие опасения на сей счет не безосновательны и если турция будет сопротивляться ей очевидно это дорого обойдется и тут даже россия не сможет помочь по сути для турции ничего не меняется то она была заложницей ситуации с россией то сейчас она может стать заложницей ситуации с сша а за всем этим стоит только одна проблема вечный конфликт с курдами и нежелание решить этот вопрос в рамках общепринятых демократических основ нам не раз приходилось наблюдать что курдская проблема подталкивает турцию на необдуманные поступки и действия особенно когда курды выходят за локальные рамки в надежде на поддержку извне а когда сама хиллари клинтон на почти решающих предвыборных дебатах открыто заявляет что будет поставлять оружие и поддерживать курдов в регионе а это значит что вопрос разделения сирии пока еще открыт и когда весь запад так или иначе делает ставки на курдов это конечно не может не отразиться на поведении эрдогана в связи с этим эрдоган решил поменять свою риторику в отношении асада и отнюдь не только из за того что на этом настаивает россия и чтобы угодить ей мы должны понять что турция сделала это чтобы проучить сша если быть честными то все понимают что экономические отношения между нашими странами имеют обоснованные причины а политическое сближение чаще всего строится на противоречиях с другими странами проучить америку турция страстно желает из за гюлена которого вашингтон отказывается выдавать и из за активной поддержки сша курдов в регионе как только эти обстоятельства изменятся изменится и все остальное еще одно раздражающее эрдогана явление это невозможность уследить за переменчивыми настроениями сша то америка поддерживает иракских курдов во главе с барзани то теперь рпк то она хочет чтобы именно турция участвовала в операциях под мосулом и раккой то наоборот считает что турция там вообще не нужна и это не что иное как стремление к деморализации эрдогана а в целом все что сегодня происходит с курдами в регионе сбивает с толку многих кому судьба курдов небезразлична и многие россияне в том числе ровным счетом не понимают регионального расклада по курдам то курды были так сказать в топе в россии и были чуть ли не главной темой после асада то вновь канули в историческое и информационное небытие при этом надо понимать что все эти скачкообразные противоречивые процессы чисто конъюнктурные и никто не знает чем все это закончится ясно одно в ближневосточном регионе ничего уже не будет как прежде и по той же логике как не будет единственного выигравшего так же и единственного проигравшего и тех и других будет несколько понятия победы и поражения в контексте сирии явления коллективные и выиграют скорее всего те кто возьмет в свою команду курдов при этом все понимают как бы ни сложились обстоятельства нужен консенсус между ведущими и второстепенными игроками почему консенсус да потому что или консенсус или третья мировая война и это надо делать пока не пройдена точка невозврата и еще потому что наверное никому не захочется остаться наедине с экономическими и социальными последствиями этой разрушительной войны хотя обострение отношений между крупными державами скорее всего продолжится до выборов в сша а потом пойдет на спад как это не раз было в истории но при условии если бы год назад россия взяла под свой полный контроль не только асада но и курдов ведь в сирии есть две реальные силы это асад и курды и вплотную занялась строительством хотя бы маленькой военной базы и сопутствующих инфраструктур которые сейчас вместо россии вполне успешно возводят соединенные штаты в сирийском курдистане то вообще бы никаких вопросов не возникло сейчас американцы либо помалкивали бы в тряпочку либо тихо ретировались в сторону ирака а сегодня момент упущен и увы придется с американцами считаться высоцкий пел как мы место шаха проворонили нам этого потомки не простят скорее всего на тот момент россия не хотела раздражать ни тегеран ни анкару ни дамаск я считаю что россия этот тонкий момент с курдами пропустила зря и в этом случае с турцией сегодня все было бы так же хорошо как сейчас и даже лучше потому что и москва и анкара в отличие от сша реально заботятся о территориальной целостности сирии именно поэтому на данном этапе такой расклад устраивал бы всех в сложившейся ситуации курдам все равно конечно но россии и турции было бы приятнее если бы в свой совместный союз они смогли включить курдов тогда я был бы спокоен за дальнейшую судьбу российско турецких отношений как я говорил неоднократно непредсказуемость турецкой внешней политики на что очень часто жалуются в россии кроется именно в нерешенности курдского вопроса хотя все еще не поздно вернее лучше поздно чем никогда читайте также',\n",
